Two-stage output requirement (for analysis only):
1) First, independently infer the medical condition label for EACH image.
   Output a single JSON object inside <labels_json>...</labels_json> that maps image keys to predicted labels.
   - Use the exact image keys shown in the prompt (e.g., A, B, C, D, ...; for query images use Q if present).
   - Each value should be a short free-text label (no extra explanation).
2) Then answer the original task. Put ONLY the final answer in <answer>...</answer> as instructed.

Expected image keys: {KEYS}
Example JSON skeleton: {EXAMPLE_JSON}

Important:
- Your response MUST start with <labels_json> and MUST include keys for ALL images listed above.
- Do NOT output <answer> until after you finish <labels_json>.
- If you are unsure about a label, still make your best guess (do not leave any value empty).

Output format (no code fences, no extra text outside the tags):
<labels_json>{"A":"...","B":"..."} </labels_json>
<answer> ... </answer>

# Authoritative Dermoscopy Visual Diagnostic Features for Skin Conditions

## 1) **Actinic Keratosis**
Common dermoscopic features:
- **Strawberry pattern**: Red background with white rings around follicular openings.
- **Linear or wavy blood vessels**: Irregular, elongated vessels.
- **Rosette sign**: Small white dots arranged in a four-leaf pattern (around hair follicles).
- **Surface scale**: White/yellow scale or crusts.
  
## 2) **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
Key dermoscopic diagnostic clues:
- **Arborizing vessels**: Thick primary blood vessels with small branches (tree-like structure).
- **Leaf-like structures**: Pale areas resembling a leaf shape.
- **Blue-gray ovoid nests**: Oval-shaped structures with a blue-gray hue.
- **Spoke-wheel structure**: Radial lines forming a spoke-like pattern around a central point.
- **Ulceration**: Presence of shallow erosion or ulceration.

## 3) **Benign Keratosis (Seborrheic Keratosis)**
Typical dermoscopic features:
- **Milia-like cysts**: Small white cystic structures.
- **Comedo-like openings**: Pore-like openings, often surrounded by a yellow or brownish hue.
- **Fissures and ridges**: Cracked or ridge-like surface patterns.
- **Fingerprint-like structures**: Patterns resembling fingerprints, commonly brownish.
- **Blue-gray globules**: Circular pigment structures, typically distributed symmetrically.

## 4) **Dermatofibroma**
Distinctive features on dermoscopy:
- **Central white patch**: Central white area with irregular shape.
- **Peripheral pigment network**: Fine pigment network or dots around the central white patch.
- **Brown homogeneous color**: Regular brown areas or streaks, typically along the periphery.

## 5) **Melanocytic Nevus (Mole)**
Key dermoscopic features:
- **Regular pigment network**: Symmetrical, regular pigmentation network.
- **Uniform brown/black globules or dots**: Evenly distributed pigment spots, primarily brown or black.
- **Symmetry**: Well-defined, symmetric shape and pattern.

## 6) **Melanoma**
Critical dermoscopic signs:
- **Irregular pigment network**: Asymmetric or irregular distribution of pigment.
- **Blue-white veil**: A characteristic veil-like structure, often over the lesion.
- **Asymmetry**: Anomalous structure or shape with uneven edges.
- **Multiple colors**: Mixing of several different colors (dark brown, black, blue, etc.).
- **Regression structures**: Areas of depigmentation or color loss, suggesting tumor regression.

## 7) **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
Important dermoscopic characteristics:
- **Polymorphous vessels**: Diverse and irregular blood vessel patterns (linear, dotted, serpentine).
- **Glomerular dots**: Clustered, glomerular vessel structures.
- **Surface scaling**: Visible keratin buildup or crusts.
- **Ulceration or bleeding**: Presence of open sores or bleeding areas.

## 8) **Vascular Lesion**
Common dermoscopic features:
- **Red-blue lacunes**: Lacy or network-like red and blue areas.
- **Homogeneous red-blue areas**: Solid, uniform areas of red and blue coloration.
- **Reactive hemangioma border**: Vascular structures that appear as rings or borders around a central lesion.
